# Fancy Form

Create a currency swap form based on the template provided in the folder.

*You may use any third party plugin, library, and/or framework for this problem.*

1. You may refer to this [swap form](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) for a reference functionality, but your output should not simply be a copy of this reference.
2. You may add input validation/error messages to make the form interactive, and implement follow-up actions when the user click on the submission button. It does not have to be the same as the reference form, you can be creative with the user flow.
3. Your submission will be rated on its usage intuitiveness and visual attractiveness.
4. Show us your frontend development and design skills, feel free to totally disregard the provided files for this problem.
5. You may use this [repo](https://github.com/Switcheo/token-icons/tree/main/tokens) for token images, e.g. [SVG image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Switcheo/token-icons/main/tokens/SWTH.svg).
6. You may use this [URL](https://interview.switcheo.com/prices.json) for token price information and to compute exchange rates (not every token has a price, those that do not can be omitted).

Please submit your solution using the files provided in the skeletal repo, including any additional files your solution may use.

ðŸ’¡ Hint: Since user-experience is a grading criteria, feel free to simulate or mock interactions (without implementing a backend service), such as implementing a mocked submission button we can interact with.
